# Modelling-Diabetes-Risk-and-BMI-Change-Using-Electronic-Health-Record-Data
This project is a two part data analysis and modelling assessment based on artificial datasets designed to resemble electronic health record (EHR) data. The goal is to apply sound statistical and data science methods to explore, model, and interpret relationships in clinical data using R.


Part A – Diabetes Prediction Model

Objective:
Develop and validate a predictive model for the presence of diabetes using physiological and genetic markers.

Includes:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics, outlier detection, and variable treatment (e.g., transformations or categorisations).
Model Building: Selection and justification of predictors, handling interactions, and feature engineering.
Model Evaluation: Assess performance using sensitivity, specificity, and other diagnostic metrics.
Sensitivity Analysis: Evaluate model robustness through subgroup analyses (e.g., by age or BMI).


Part B – Smoking Cessation and BMI Change

Objective:
Estimate the causal effect of smoking cessation on 5-year BMI change (%).

Include:
Descriptive data summary and exploration.
Linear regression models (unadjusted and adjusted) to estimate associations.
Application of inverse probability weighting (IPW) to control for confounders.
Use of the g-formula to estimate counterfactual BMI outcomes:
If nobody quit smoking
If everyone quit smoking
